User openweather APIs to collect weather info of the travel location
Hosted front-end source on flask server, running locally, which will accept user input and send to dify backend using dify APIs, where actual processing happens using OpenWeather APIs to collect weather data and GPT3.5-Turbo to generate a travel plan as per the weather and respond. Response is sent back to the front-end for user consumption. Another Dify API is enabled for suggested messages, which is currently not accepted as new input in the chatflow, but can be considered towards project extension.
